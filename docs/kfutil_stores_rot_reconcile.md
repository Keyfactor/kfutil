## kfutil stores rot reconcile

Reconcile either takes in or will generate an audit report and then add/remove certs as needed.

### Synopsis

Root of Trust (rot): Will parse either a combination of CSV files that define certs to 
add and/or certs to remove with a CSV of certificate stores or an audit CSV file. If an audit CSV file is provided, the 
add and remove actions defined in the audit file will be immediately executed. If a combination of CSV files are provided,
the utility will first generate an audit report and then execute the add/remove actions defined in the audit report.
